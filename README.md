# Cybersecurity-Project-2
  Offensive and Defensive Security Project

## This presentation explains the following:

1. Vulnerabilities exploited of a Capstone VM
2. Analysis of data by viewing logs using Kibana
3. Proposed mitigation strategies.

During this project, I played the role of a hacker to infiltrate a machine. I also played the defensive security role by viewing logs and determining best practices to protect the system.
