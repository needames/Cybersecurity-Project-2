# Cybersecurity-Project-2
  Offensive and Defensive Security Project

## This presentation explains the following:

1. vulnerabilities exploited of a Capstone VM
2. analysis of data by viewing logs using Kibana
3. proposed mitigation strategies.
During this project, I acted as a hacker to infiltrate a machine. I also played the defensive security role by viewing logs and determining best practices to protect the system.
